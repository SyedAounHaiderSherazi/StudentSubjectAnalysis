Write a c++ program for analyzing student grades in 3 subjects using arrays. The program should:
● Read a file "grades.txt" where the first line contains the number of students and the subsequent lines
contain the grades for each student in each subject.
● Store and display the grades of each student using arrays.
● Calculate and display the average grade for each student and each subject.
● Determine and display the student with the highest average and the subject with the lowest average.
● Output all the above results to a file "analysis.txt".
● Compute the average grade for each student and store it in a 1D array.
● Compute the average grade for each subject and store it in a 1D array.
● Write the names and average grades of each student to a file named "student_averages.txt".
● Write the average grades of each subject to a file named "subject_averages.txt".
● You have to make proper functions to perform each functionality.
